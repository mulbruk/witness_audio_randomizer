1) **Witness directory**:  
The location in which The Witness is installed. Default location is `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\The Witness\`. After selecting a directory in which the game files are detected, a backup will be created of the data files affected by the randomizer. This backup will use about 2.5GB of space.
2) **Seed value**: 
The seed value used for randomization. It doesn't really matter what value is used. ヽ(ー_ー )ノ
3) **Audio logs directory**: 
The location in which the audio and (optional) subtitle files you wish to insert are located.
4) **Restore data files**: 
Restores the backed up files and returns the game to its original state.
5) **I'm feeling lucky**: 
Press only if you feel lucky!	(=^ ◡ ^=)
Will rearrange the audio logs using data files from the game. Useful if you don't have any (or very few) custom audio logs to insert.
6) **Randomize**: 
Randomly insert the selected audio logs into The Witness.
7) **Dump audio logs**: 
Extracts all audio logs and subtitles from the game's data files to a location of your choosing.

1) **Witness directory**: 
The location in which The Witness is installed. Default location is `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\The Witness\`. After selecting a directory in which the game files are detected, a backup will be created of the data files affected by the randomizer.
2) **Test file path**: 
Location of the `.ogg` file to insert. If a `.sub` file with the same name is located in the same directory as the `.ogg`, it will be inserted as well.
3) **Insert log**: 
Insert the selected audio log file. The log will replace the mountaintop log in the game.
